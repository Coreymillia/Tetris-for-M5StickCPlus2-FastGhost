Colors change with each line clear. This was an accident but decided to roll with it. It is due to an error in the level count and line count getting mixed up. Speed progression may or may not work. I got 91 lines on the first test and did not lose, but had other things to do. So level 9 was still no problem. I feel like it was working.
HARD DROP press up on JoyC Hat.
New border to omit the void on each side, all giving it the feel of a modern Tetris.
